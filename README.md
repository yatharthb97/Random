#Entropy generation module

##Aims of the library:
+   Offer convenient way of saving and loading of entropy engines within simulations
+   To build a convenient domain model that handles the domain complexity of the PRNGs in use.
+   To build an efficient and close-to-no-overhead wrapper around the default C++ implementations of the random header.
+   A convenient namespace hierarcy for Entropy generation module.
+   

##Salient Features
+ Funcrtions that describe all seeding mechanisms.
+ A convenient and permiable error code system.
+ Easy way to sample common distributions - gauss and uniform within unity range.
